# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was intrigued by sorting algorithms, after first coming across them during my maths course at college, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it!

Everything related to this project is located under /src/SortingVisualizer and /src/sortingAlgorithms. The SortingVisualizer component is imported and rendered in App.js.


This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
